                            <p>As San Clan Ent, we also have some guiding questions that we also refer to, as a reminder. Those questions allow us to move into a higher level of thinking, by providing a more open-ended support that turns our attention towards key details without being perspective. Those questions are,  “How can my actions eventually change the world”, “How can we ensure that conflicts lead to constructive change and positive outcomes for everyone involved”, and “How can we create, test and validate a model that will benefit society, in more ways than one."</p>
